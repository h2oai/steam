# Introduction

Steam is an "instant on" platform that streamlines the entire process of building and deploying applications. It is the industry's first data science hub that lets data scientists and developers collaboratively build, deploy, and refine predictive applications across large scale data sets. Data scientists can publish Python and R code as REST APIs and easily integrate with production applications.

Steam is available for download at <a href="http://www.h2o.ai/steam/">h2o.ai/steam/</a>.
