Overview
========

Steam is an "instant on" platform that streamlines the entire process of building and
deploying applications. It is the industry's first data science hub that lets data scientists
and developers collaboratively build, deploy, and refine predictive applications across
large scale datasets. Data scientists can publish Python and R code as REST APIs and
easily integrate with production applications.

This document describes how to start and use Steam and the Steam Scoring Service.
Note that this document assumes that an admin has successfully installed and started
Steam on a YARN edge node using the instructions provided in the Steam Installation
and Setup steps.

**Note**: Before you begin using Steam, be sure that your minimum version of H2O
is 3.10.0.7. Earlier versions are not supported. If necessary, follow the instructions
on the `H2O Download page <http://h2o.ai/download>`__ for your platform to upgrade H2O.
