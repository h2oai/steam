Projects
========

Steam makes use of project-based machine learning. Whether you are trying to detect fraud or predict user retention, the datasets, models, and test results are stored and saved in the individual projects. All Steam users within your environment can access these projects and the files within them.

The Steam Projects page includes additional subnavigation items for Models, Deployment, Configuration, and Collaborators. Each of these pages is described in later sections. 

Creating a Project
------------------

Before you can create a project, be sure that H2O is running on an available cluster.

1. To start a new project, click the **Start A New Project** button on the Welcome page.
2. When you first log in to Steam, the list of clusters will be empty. Enter the IP address of the cluster that is running H2O, then click **Connect**. 
3. Once connected, the current list of clusters will immediately populate with the cluster's information. Click **Connect** beside this cluster to continue.

4. Select an available H2O frame from the Datasets dropdown, then select
   the Model Category. Note that these dropdowns are automatically populated
   with information from datasets that are available on the selected
   cluster. If no datasets are available, then the dropdown lists will be
   empty. For clusters that contain datasets, after a dataset is
   selected, a list of corresponding model will display.
5. Select the checkbox beside the model(s) to import into the Steam
   project. 
6. Specify a name for the project.

Models
------

The **Models** page shows a list of all models included in a selected
Project. This list also includes summary information for each model.
This information varies based on whether the model is binomial or
regresssion.

For binomial models, the following values will display on the Models
page.

-  AUC
-  Gini
-  MSE
-  Logloss
-  ROC

For regression models, the following values will display on the Models
page.

-  MRD
-  MSE
-  R^2

   Models page

You can perform the following actions directly from this page:

-  Import a new model
-  View model details and export the model as a java, jar, or war file
-  Label a model (Refer to `Configurations`_ for information on how to create labels.)
-  Deploy the model

    **Note**: The Models page lists models in alphabetical order and
    shows up to five models per page. If your project includes more than five
    models, use the forward and back arrows at the bottom of the page to
    view more models.

Importing Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After models are added to an H2O cluster, they can be imported into an
existing Steam project. In the upper-right corner of the Models page,
click the **Import Models** button. This opens an Import Models popup
form.

The Cluster dropdown automatically populates with a list H2O clusters.
Specify the H2O cluster that has the models you want to import, then
select the additional model or models that you want to add to the
project.

   :alt: Model Details page

   Model Details page

This page provides information about when the model was created, the
algorithm and dataset used to create the model, and the response column
specified when the model was built. The Goodness of Fit section provides
value information for the model, including the Mean Squared Error,
LogLoss, R^2, AUC, and Gini score. An ROC curve is available for
binomial models.

From this page, you can perform the following actions:

-  `Comparing Models`_
-  `Deploying a Model`_
-  `Exporting a Model`_

Comparing Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deploying a Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After comparing models, you might decide to deploy one or more of the
best models. Perform the steps below to deploy a model.

1. While viewing the model details, click the **Deploy Model** button.
   (Note that this can also be done directly from the **Models** page by
   selecting the **deploy model** link in the Action column.)
2. Specify a service name for the deployment.
3. To perform pre-processing on the model, specify a Preprocessing
   Script. Note that this dropdown is populated with scripts that are
   added to the project. Information about adding preprocessing scripts
   is available in the `Deployment`_ section.
4. Click **Deploy** when you are done.

2. Make predictions by specifying input values based on column data from
   the original dataset. This automatically populates the fields in the
   query string. (Note that you can optionally include input parameters
   directly in the query string instead of specifying parameters.)

3. Click **Predict** when you are done.

**Notes**: 
 - Use the **Clear** button to clear all entries and begin a new prediction. 
 - Use the **More Stats** button to view additional statistics about the scoring service results.
 - The Steam Prediction Service is available as a completely standalone utility. Refer to the `Prediction Service Builder <prediction_service.html>`__ appendix for more information about using the Prediction Service Builder. 

Configurations
--------------

When maintaining and storing models in Steam, it is useful to know whether the version of a model that you're viewing is used for testing, development, production, etc. Steam allows admins/superusers to set labels (or versioning) for models and to apply permissions for those models using the labels. The Steam admin/superuser is responsible for creating new Steam users and setting roles and workgroups for those users. When setting Steam project configurations, labels can be created that allow, for example, only users in a Production workgroup to label a model as a Deployment model.

When a label is applied to a model, the Project Configurations page will show all models associated with a label.
