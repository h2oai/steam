User Management Overview
========================

Before using Steam, it is important to understand User Management within
your YARN environment. In Steam, User Management is supported in a
database. The User Management functions in Steam determine
the level of access that users have for Steam features. The Steam
database supports setup via CLI commands. Refer to the `CLI Command
Reference Appendix <CLIAppendix.html>`__ for a list of all
available CLI commands.

For more information on Steam User Management, refer to the following
sections.

-  `Privileges/Access Control`_

Terms
-----

The following lists common terms used when describing Steam User
Management.

-  **Entities** represent *objects* in Steam. Examples of entities
   include Roles, Workgroups, Identities, Clusters, Projects, Models,
   and Services (engines).

-  **Identities** represent *users* in Steam. Users sign in using an
   Identity, and then perform operations in Steam.

-  **Permissions** determine what operations you can perform. Examples
   of permissions include Manage Clusters, View Clusters, Manage
   Models, View Models, and so on.

-  **Privileges** determine the entities that you can perform operations
   on (i.e., data / access control).

Privileges/Access Control
-------------------------

Privileges are uniquely identified by the entity in question and the
kind of privilege you have on the entity.

The following privileges are available on an entity:

-  **Own** privileges allow you to share, view, edit, and delete
   entities.

-  **Edit** privileges allow you to view and edit entities, but not
   share or delete them.

-  **View** privileges allow you to view entities, but not share, edit,
   or delete them.

When you create an entity, you immediately *Own* it. You can then share
this entity with others and award them either *Edit* or *View*
privileges. Entities are allowed to have more than one owner, so you can
also add additional owners to entities.

The following table lists the kind of privileges you need in order to
perform specific operations on entities:

Authorization
-------------

Permissions and privileges are set up using Roles and Workgroups,
respectively.

-  Identities cannot be linked directly to permissions. For that, you'll
   need Roles.

-  Identities cannot be linked directly to privileges on entities. For
   that, you'll need Workgroups, i.e. when you share entities with
   others, you would be sharing those entities with workgroups, not
   individuals.

Roles
~~~~~

A **Role** is a named set of permissions. Roles allow you define a
cohesive set of permissions into operational roles and then have
multiple identities *play* those roles, regardless of access control.
For example:

-  a *Data Scientist* role can be composed of the permissions *View
   Clusters*, *Manage Models*, *View Models*.
-  an *Operations* role can be composed of the permissions *View
   Models*, *View Services*, *Manage Services*,
-  a *Manager* role can be composed of the permissions *Manage Roles*,
   *View Roles*, *Manage Workgroups*, *View Workgroups*

Workgroups
~~~~~~~~~~

A **Workgroup** is a named set of identities. Workgroups allow you to
form collections of identities for access control purposes. For example,
a *Demand Forecasting* workgroup can be composed of all the users
working on demand forecasting, regardless of their role. This workgroup
can be then used to control access to all the clusters, projects, models
and services that are used for demand forecasting.

User Management Workflow
------------------------

The steps below provide a common workflow to follow when creating users.
This workflow is followed in the example that follows.

1. Define roles based on operational needs.
2. Define workgroups based on data / access control needs.
3. Then add a new user:

 a.  Create the user's identity.
 b.  Associate the user with one or more roles.
 c.  Optionally, associate the user with one or more workgroups.

User Management Example
-----------------------

The following example creates sample roles, workgroups, and users using the CLI. Refer to the `CLI Command Reference <CLIAppendix.html>`__  for information about all of the commands available in the CLI.

1. Log in as the Steam superuser on the machine that is running Steam.

 ::

  ./steam login <yarn_edge_node>:<port> --username=superuser --password=superuser

2. Create an engineer role, and link that role to permissions. Note that
   you can run ``./steam get all permissions`` to view a list of available
   permissions.

 ::

  ./steam create role --name="engineer" --description="a default engineer role"
  RoleId: 2
  ./steam link role --with-permission --role-id=2 --permission-id=18
  ./steam link role --with-permission --role-id=2 --permission-id=12
  ./steam link role --with-permission --role-id=2 --permission-id=4

3. Create a data scientist role, and link that role to permissions.

 ::

  ./steam create role --name="datascience" --description="a default data scientist role"
  RoleId: 3
  ./steam link role --with-permission --role-id=3 --permission-id=11
  ./steam link role --with-permission --role-id=3 --permission-id=17
  ./steam link role --with-permission --role-id=3 --permission-id=15
  ./steam link role --with-permission --role-id=3 --permission-id=13


4. Create preparation and production workgroups.

 ::

  ./steam create workgroup --name="preparation" --description="data prep group"
  WorkgroupId:    1
  ./steam create workgroup --name="production" --description="production group"
  WorkgroupId:    2

5. Create two users - Bob and Jim.

 ::

  ./steam create identity --name="bob" --password="bobSpassword"
  IdentityId: 2
  ./steam create identity --name="jim" --password="j1mSpassword"
  IdentityId: 3

6. Link Bob to engineer role; link Jim to datascience role.

 ::

  ./steam link identity --with-role --identity-id=2 --role-id=2
  ./steam link identity --with-role --identity-id=3 --role-id=3

7. Link Bob to preparation workgroup; link Jim to production workgroup.

 ::
 
  ./steam link identity --with-workgroup --identity-id=2 --workgroup-id=1
  ./steam link identity --with-workgroup --identity-id=3 --workgroup-id=2


Next Steps
----------

Now that you understand User Management, you can create your own roles,
workgroups, and users. Once created, be sure to provide your users with
their Steam login credentials.
