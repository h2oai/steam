## Logging in to Steam

In a Chrome web browser, navigate to the Steam web server using the login credentials provided by your admin and/or Steam superuser. This Steam web server is the server on which an admin has installed Steam (for example, http://192.16.2.182:9000). Contact your admin for the IP address and for credentials.

### The Steam UI

The first time you log in to Steam, an empty Steam page will display, prompting you to start a project. Be sure to accept the terms and conditions in order to continue.

The left navigation provides quick links for all the following: 

- All projects available on the Steam cluster
- Deployed services, including pre-processing packages
- Cluster details
- E-mail link to Steam support at H2O
- Logging out

>**Note**: When Steam is started for the first time, no projects, services, or clusters will appear in the UI. 

Accept the terms of this preview release, then click **Start a New Project**. This opens a page allowing you to start a new project from scratch or to begin importing models into your Steam environment. Refer to the next section for information about Steam projects.
