Logging in to Steam
-------------------

In a Chrome web browser, navigate to the Steam web server using the
login credentials provided by your admin and/or Steam admin. This
Steam web server is the server on which an admin has installed Steam
(for example, http://192.16.2.182:9000). Contact your admin for the IP
address and for credentials.

**Note**: If you installed Steam on a local machine, then you can navigate to localhost:9000. 

The Steam UI
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first time you log in to Steam, an empty Steam page will display, prompting you to start a project.

   Welcome page

The left navigation provides quick links for all the following:

-  All projects available on the Steam cluster
-  Deployed services, including pre-processing packages
-  Cluster details
-  A list of users and roles
-  An e-mail link to Steam support at H2O
-  A logout button

    **Note**: When Steam is started for the first time, no projects,
    services, or clusters will appear in the UI.

Click **Start a New Project** to begin. This opens a page allowing you to start a new project from scratch or to begin importing models into your Steam environment. Refer to the next section for information about creating Steam projects.
