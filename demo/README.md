# Steam Standalone Guide

This document describes how to get up and running with Steam without the need for a local running instance of YARN. These instructions will walk through the following procedures:

- Installing and starting Steam, the Compilation Service, and H2O
- Adding Roles, Workgroups, and Users to the database
- Building a simple model in Python (Optional for users who don't have an existing demo.)
- Deploying the model using Steam
- Making predictions using the Steam Prediction Service

These steps were created using H2O version 3.10.0.7, and that version resides in a Downloads folder. Wherever used, this version number and path should be adjusted to match your version and path.

## <a name="startingsteam"></a>Starting Steam

This section describes how to set up and start Steam and start the Steam CLI for user management.

1. Go to the <a href="http://h2o.ai/download">H2O Download</a> site and download Steam. 

2. Change directories to the Steam download file and untar the file.
    
		cd ~/Downloads/steam-1.0.0-darwin-amd64
		tar -xzvf steam-1.0.0-darwin-amd64.tar.gz 

3. Change directories to your Steam directory, and start the Jetty server.

        cd steam-master-darwin-amd64
        java -jar var/master/assets/jetty-runner.jar var/master/assets/ROOT.war
		
 >***Note***: The Jetty server defaults to port 8080. You can optionally provide a `--port` value for **jetty-runner.jar**.
		
4. Open another terminal window. From within the **steam-master-darwin-amd64** folder, start the Steam compilation and scoring service. Be sure to include the ``--superuser-name=superuser`` and ``--superuser-password=superuser`` flags. (Or provide a more secure password.) This starts Steam on localhost:9000 and creates a Steam superuser. The Steam superuser is responsible for creating roles, workgroups, and users and maintains the H2O cluster.

        ./steam serve master --superuser-name=superuser --superuser-password=superuser

 This starts the Steam web service on `localhost:9000`, the compilation service on `localhost:8080` (same as the Jetty server), and the scoring service to the external IP address of `localhost`. You can change these using `--compilation-service-address=<ip_address:port>` and `--scoring-service-address=<ip_address>`. Use `./steam help serve master` or `./steam serve master -h` to view additional options.
 
 >***Note***: If you are demoing Steam and do not have an Internet connection, you can set the scoring service to point to localhost using `--scoring-service-address=localhost`. 

5. Open another terminal window to run CLI commands. From within the Steam folder, log in to the machine running Steam (localhost:9000). Use the superuser login and password that you created in the previous step.

        ./steam login localhost:9000 --username=superuser --password=superuser
   <!-- -->

6. Run the following to verify that the CLI is working correctly.

        ./steam help
		
At this point, you can open a browser and navigate to localhost:9000. Note that you may be prompted to once more provide the login credentials created in Step 4. 

The next section describes how to add additional users to the Steam database. 

### <a name="adding"></a>Adding Roles, Workgroups, and Users

The following example creates sample roles, workgroups, and users using the CLI. Refer to the Appendix at the end of this document or to the <a href="https://github.com/h2oai/steamY/tree/master/docs/cli">CLI Commands</a> in GitHub for information about all of the commands available in the CLI.

1. Create an engineer role and link that role to permissions. Note that you can use `./steam get all --permissions` to view all available permissions and their corresponding IDs. 

		./steam create role --name="engineer" --description="a default engineer role"
		RoleId:	2
		./steam link role --with-permission=true --role-id=2 --permission-id=18
		./steam link role --with-permission=true --role-id=2 --permission-id=4
		./steam link role --with-permission=true --role-id=2 --permission-id=12
	<!-- -->
		
1. Create a data scientist role and link that role to permissions.

		./steam create role --name="datascience" --description="a default data scientist role"
		RoleId:	3
		./steam link role --with-permission=true --role-id=3 --permission-id=11
		./steam link role --with-permission=true --role-id=3 --permission-id=17
		./steam link role --with-permission=true --role-id=3 --permission-id=10
	<!-- -->
		
1. Create preparation and production workgroups.

		./steam create workgroup --name="preparation" --description="data prep group"
		WorkgroupId:	2
		./steam create workgroup --name="production" --description="production group"
		WorkgroupId:	3
   <!-- -->
		
1. Create two users - Bob and Jim.

		./steam create identity --name="bob" --password="bobSpassword"
		./steam create identity --name="jim" --password="j1mSpassword"
   <!-- -->
		
1. Link Bob to the engineer role; link Jim to the datascience role.

		./steam link identity --with-role --identity-id=2 --role-id=2
		./steam link identity --with-role --identity-id=3 --role-id=3
   <!-- -->
		
1. Link Bob to the preparation workgroup; link Jim to the production workgroup.

		./steam link identity --with-workgroup --identity-id=2 --workgroup-id=2
		./steam link identity --with-workgroup --identity-id=3 --workgroup-id=3

## <a name="startingh2o"></a>Starting H2O and Building a Model

In order to create a project in Steam, your cluster must already have at least a single dataset. This section describes how to start H2O and runs a small Python demo for adding a dataset and building a model. 

### <a name="starth2o"></a>Start H2O

1. Open another terminal window. Navigate to the folder with your H2O jar file and start H2O. This will create a one-node cluster on your local machine on port 54321.

		cd ~/Downloads/h2o-3.10.0.3
		java -jar h2o.jar 

### <a name="buildmodel"></a>Build a Model

The following steps show how to build model using the Iris dataset and the GBM algorithm. The steps will be run using H2O in Python. Once created, the model can be selected in Steam when creating a new project.

>**Note**: The rest of section can be skipped if you already have demo steps that you use in R, Python, or Flow. If you use another demo, be sure that you initialize H2O on your local cluster so that the data will be available in Steam. 

 >	Additional demos for Python are available <a href="https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/tree/master/h2o-py/demos" target="_blank">here</a>.
 
 > Demos for R are available <a href="https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/tree/master/h2o-r/demos" target="_blank">here</a>. 
 
 > A demo of Flow can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=wzeuFfbW7WE" target="_blank">here</a>. 

1. Open a terminal window. Change directories to the H2O folder, and start Python. Import the modules that will be used for this demo. 

        $ cd ~/Downloads/h2o-3.10.0.3
        $ python
        >>> import h2o
        >>> from h2o.estimators.gbm import H2OGradientBoostingEstimator
   <!-- -->

1. Initialize H2O. By default, this starts H2O on localhost and port 54321. (Note that if started Steam on a different machine, then replace `localhost` with the IP address of that machine.)

        >>> h2o.init()
		Checking whether there is an H2O instance running at http://localhost:54321..... not found.
		Attempting to start a local H2O server...
		  Java Version: java version "1.8.0_25"; Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_25-b17); Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.25-b02, mixed mode)
		  Starting server from /usr/local/h2o_jar/h2o.jar

		  Server is running at http://127.0.0.1:54321
		Connecting to H2O server at http://127.0.0.1:54321... successful.

 >**Note**: After initializing, verify that the H2O cluster version is 3.10.0.3 or greater. Steam will not run on earlier versions. If necessary, follow the instructions on the <a href="http://www.h2o.ai/download/h2o/python">http://www.h2o.ai/download/h2o/python</a> or <a href="http://www.h2o.ai/download/h2o/r">http://www.h2o.ai/download/h2o/r</a> page to upgrade H2O for Python or R.

3. Upload the Iris dataset. Note that in this example, Python is running from the Downloads folder, and the Iris dataset is on the Desktop:

        >>> df=h2o.upload_file("../../Desktop/iris.csv")
   <!-- -->

4. Specify the configuration options to use when building a GBM model.

        >>> gbm_regressor = H2OGradientBoostingEstimator(distribution="gaussian", ntrees=10, max_depth=3, min_rows=2, learn_rate=0.2)
   <!-- -->

5. Train the model using the Iris dataset (`df` object) and the GBM configuration options. 

        >>> gbm_regressor.train(x=range(1, df.ncol), y=0, training_frame=df)
   <!-- -->

6. Optionally view the model details.

        >>> gbm_regressor

Once created, the model can be added to the Steam UI. 

# <a name="projects"></a>Projects

Steam makes use of project-based machine learning. Whether you are trying to detect fraud or predict user retention, the datasets, models, and test results are stored and saved in the individual projects. All Steam users within your environment can access these projects and the files within them.

## <a name="createsteamproject"></a>Creating a Steam Project
